    Set the path to the Klocwork Server installation (p.e. if you installed Klocwork Server in HOME/Klocwork/Server,
    <br/>you should write HOME/Klocwork/Server, and replace HOME by its value.
    <br/>
    <!--<br/>If your installation path contains spaces, the build might not work. Therefore, I suggest you to set up a path with links to
     <br/>the binaries such as things/path/to/links/bin/*links* (note that on Windows platforms, you will have to use *.exe.lnk files).
     <br/>
     <br/>Anyway, -->You must specify the path WITHOUT the bin/ directory (p.e. with the links path above, you will write
    things/path/to/links).
