  Select whether you would like to build the project using a build command or using an already existing build specification.
  <h3>Build Command</h3>When using a build command, be sure to prefix the command with the Klocwork command kwinject (C/C++) or kwant (Java) in the following manor <br /> <tt>kwinject < build_command ></tt><br />
  A build command can either be a compile command (e.g. <tt>gcc -c /opt/this_project/src/file.cpp</tt>) or the use of a makefile. Using this method you can also specify Klocwork options, such as <tt>kwinject --update make</tt><br />
  <p>Do not specify the --output option as this plugin assumes the name of the build specification.<br /><br />
  <h3>Build Specification</h3>
  When choosing to build the project from a build specification, be sure to provide the absolute or relative path to the build specification from the project workspace.
