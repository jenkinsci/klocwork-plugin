<p>
    Leave the build name empty to use the default ci_ build name for Klocwork.
    <br/><br/>Add your prefix/suffix e.g. jenkins_ and a Jenkins variable that
    gets incremented such as the build number.<br/><br/>Or specify the exact name 
    for the build, note however this will need to be changed for the next build 
    otherwise it will not load to Klocwork on the second run.
