  <h3>Klocwork Quality Gateway</h3>
  <p>
      This feature allows for quick, incremental analyses of changed source files
      to enable pre/post-checkin/commit like behaviour.
      The idea is that only changed files are analysed using the Klocwork
      Desktop/User tools to replicate the analysis developers would perform using
      Visual Studio, Eclipse or the command line utility.
  </p>
  <h4>Diff File List</h4>
  <p>
      The diff file list is the file to contain the changed source files
      that Klocwork should analyse. It is required that any analysed files should
      exist in the build specification generated by kwinject
  </p>
  <h5>Using Git</h5>
  <p>
      If using Git, please provide the previous commit that Git should perform
      a "diff" with. The change list between the current commit and the specified
      previous commit will then be added to the diff file list for Klocwork to
      process by automatically calling "git diff &#60;previous_commit&#62;" during the
      build.
  </p>
  <h5>Manual</h5>
  <p>
      If you are not using Git, or want to manually generate the change list
      using Git, then please select this option. You will need to generate the
      diff file list with a custom build-step (or similar). Future support for
      more SCM tools (such as SVN, perforce) may be added depending on demand.
      The format of the file should be a changed source file per line
