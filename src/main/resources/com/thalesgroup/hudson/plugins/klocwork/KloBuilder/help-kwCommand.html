	If you have selected to build using a build command, enter the command that generates the file kwinject.out (the file
	that contains information used by Klocwork to build the report).<br/>
    For Java project, you can use kwant command and for C/C++ project, you can use kwinject command.<br/><br/>

    <b>Please do not use the --output option or the build will fail.</b> If you need the output file, you can retrieve
    it in the workspace of your project. The file is called kwinject.out. <br /> <br />
	If you have selected to build using an existing build specification file, enter the full or relative path to that
	file.
